## Contributing
You can contribute in the following ways:
- Add a new react expert or topic
- Suggest changes to the existing topic
- Discuss ideas on github issues
- Spread the word

## Guidelines
- Adding everything about react is not the goal!
  - Right now we are focusing on the topics that are essential in every react project.
- Do not add or suggest things you have not evaluated personally!
  - Do your research before suggesting any topic or expert. Give honest arguments for why the resource should be included.
- One item per Pull Request
  - Adding one item like one topic or covering one expert per pull request makes it easy to maintain the repo.
- Write meaningful commit messages
- Look at the existing issues/pull requests before opening new ones

## Pull Request Protocols
Please ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:
- For feature, follow this branch naming convention `feature-ISSUE_NUMBER-short-description-of-feature`
  - For example: `feature-1-contributor-guide-for-project`

- PR title should follow the convention `Feature | ISSUE_NUMBER | Short Description Of Feature`
  - For example: `Feature | Issue #2 | Contributor Guide For Project`
- For bugs and fixes, replace feature with `Fix` remaining will be the same
